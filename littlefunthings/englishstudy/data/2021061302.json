Sadly, we both used words that were hurtful. Afterward, I wrote her a note telling her I loved her and would like to hear from her. She replied in an email that she received my letter, but she is still hurt by the things I said. I wanted to be the adult in this situation, but I was also hurt by her words and actions, and feel angry that I have to be the one to apologize. I told her I hope that we can put this behind us. Must I apologize even though I told her I am sorry that she is still hurt? -- WOUNDED IN OHIO.", "linesSec2": "DEAR WOUNDED: I see nothing positive to be gained by allowing this to fester any longer. You are the parent in this situation, so if you'd like a resolution, apologize again." } ] }
