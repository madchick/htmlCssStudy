{ "title": "Man's Death and Its Aftermath Leave Family Struggling", "info":"Dear Abby | July 3rd, 2021 | Letter 2 of 2", "image1":"./images/0301.jpg", "image2":"./images/0302.jpg", "lines":[ { "linesSec1": "DEAR ABBY: My heart is heavy for my sister-in-law, Becca, and her family. Her brother recently passed away. He'd been ill, but no one expected his death. To make matters worse, his wife didn't contact his family about his death for several days and had him cremated without notifying them. They learned about his death when his obit was posted on Facebook. From what I've been told, his wife has had little to no contact with his family. Becca can't understand what could have been her problem. He was an only son and brother. They didn't have an opportunity to say goodbye; therefore, they don't have closure. His sister and mother are grief-stricken and angry. I can only offer words of comfort and prayers. With so many unanswered questions behind all of this, what is the best way to offer comfort and support? Or should I just give them time? -- SO MUCH PAIN.", "linesSec2": "DEAR SO MUCH PAIN: Please accept my condolences for your family's loss. Call Becca and her family often. Even better, deliver your words of comfort by visiting in person if she would appreciate the company. Offer to help with shopping for groceries, laundry -- whatever she might be too depressed to do herself right now. And then give her time to heal." } ] }
