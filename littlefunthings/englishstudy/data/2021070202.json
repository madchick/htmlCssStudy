This boy I liked played me, and I don't know whether I should just accept the fact that he's bad and move on or be sad and wait it out. I told him I'm not a Barbie doll he can pick up and play with when he's bored, but I still like him. Do you have any advice for me? -- BROKEN HEART IN OHIO.", "linesSec2": "DEAR BROKEN HEART: Yes, I do. Be glad you see this person for exactly who he is -- someone who cannot be relied upon -- and move on. I think you said it very well when you told him you aren't a toy to be played with. Now, learn from this experience and choose your next boyfriend accordingly." } ] }
