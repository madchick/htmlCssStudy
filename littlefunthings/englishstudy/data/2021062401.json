I called maintenance and texted my upstairs neighbor, who asked me when they were coming. I responded that I didn't know and I wasn't sure whether they'd have to go up to her apartment or not. Well, they went to her apartment first. She was VERY upset and messaged me a dozen more times to let me know how stressed she was, that she was crying and afraid she would get evicted from her apartment because she has a dog she failed to put on her lease. She ended by saying next time I should let her know in advance. Abby, I did let her know. But I guess she wants more notice next time she causes an emergency, so she'll have more time to hide her dog. So -- I'm supposed to let my apartment get more water damage to give her time to hide an animal she should've put on her lease years ago and be paying pet rent for? I feel like she was trying to make me feel bad when she's the one who is wrong for being irresponsible. Why do I have to cater to her needs first? Should I feel bad? -- LEAKY MESS IN THE WEST.", "linesSec2": "DEAR LEAKY MESS: You do not have to accept the guilt trip your neighbor laid on you or cater to her. You handled the situation appropriately and have nothing to apologize for. When the good neighbor policy was written, she must have been out to lunch." } ] }
