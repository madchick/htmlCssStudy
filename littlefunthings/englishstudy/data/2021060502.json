My husband, Hank, and I are invited to the wedding. We live 1,000 miles away, so we have to book a flight, reserve a hotel and pay for all our meals. Hank has been waiting the last three months for a date for knee surgery. Most of the time, he's in pain -- especially when he walks. My daughter thinks we should postpone his surgery to attend the wedding. What do you think? -- DEBATING IN THE SOUTH.", "linesSec2": "DEAR DEBATING: Of course your daughter wants her father at her son's wedding. That she would be disappointed -- as would the both of you -- is understandable. But does she really want him there limping, wincing and in constant pain? Remind her that it has taken three months to get this surgery calendared. Tell her you will be with them in spirit on their special day, but her father's health must come first. Then stick to your guns." } ] }
