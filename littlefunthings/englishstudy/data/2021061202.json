I would like to help him out with a gift of money, with no expectation that he would repay the money. However, he's very proud, and I'm afraid he would be insulted if I offer him the money. It could also damage our relationship, which has always been very good. Can you offer any words that could persuade him to accept this gift? You often have a tactful approach that can help to maintain a positive relationship but still allow a person to accomplish their desired goal. -- PROUD IN NEW YORK.", "linesSec2": "DEAR PROUD: If it were my relative, this is the approach I would take: Uncle Charlie, you have been wonderfully supportive of me over the years. (Be specific about a couple of instances; they do not have to have anything to do with money -- in fact, it's better if they don't.) You would be doing me a great favor if you would please accept this because this past year has been so difficult for so many people, and I have been concerned about you. Then I'd cross my fingers." } ] }
