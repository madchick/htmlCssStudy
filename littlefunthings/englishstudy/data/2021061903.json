The book was $20. After describing the book and her mother, she offered one to each of us to purchase! We're not poor, but I thought she showed poor taste by pushing this book on us. We all bought one because we felt obligated. What's your opinion about what she did? What would have been a tactful way to refuse? -- DUMBSTRUCK.", "linesSec2": "DEAR DUMBSTRUCK: You could have thanked the woman for offering the book, told her you are sure it was wonderful and refused by saying, But I'm just not into poetry!" } ] }
