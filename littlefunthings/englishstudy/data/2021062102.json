It doesn't matter what she cooks, Abby, it's always awful. Everyone tries whatever it is she made, but then spits it out. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't want her to bring anything ever again that isn't store-bought. How can I tell her tactfully? -- REPULSED IN VIRGINIA.", "linesSec2": "DEAR REPULSED: Tell your generous friend that you appreciate the thought behind what she has been doing, but when you invite guests over your menu is already set. She is the kind of helpful guest who should be commissioned to bring a store-bought beverage, dinner rolls or napkins." } ] }
