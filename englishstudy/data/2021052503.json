I regard it as a lack of respect for our marriage, which has been under a lot of stress for a long time. (No affairs.) I also view it as symbolic of how much she has financially sacrificed being married to me. What do you think? -- WONDERING IN THE EAST.", "linesSec2": "DEAR WONDERING: I think you should tell your wife it would hurt you deeply if she follows through, and why. I also think the time has come for the two of you to talk about what is stressing your marriage with a licensed marriage and family therapist." } ] }
