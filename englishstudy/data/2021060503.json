The person next to me is diabetic and wears a beeper that goes off all day long. Am I supposed to endure this annoying sound even though she can put it on vibrate? -- DISTURBED IN TEXAS.", "linesSec2": "DEAR DISTURBED: No, you are not. Ask your co-worker if putting her beeper on vibrate would work for her, because the sound distracts you. If she's willing to do that, your problem is solved. However, if she isn't, then it may be time to discuss this with your supervisor or employer because it may be possible to relocate your workstation to another area." } ] }
