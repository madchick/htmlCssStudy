My 80-year-old father LOVES to hear me play. I am an accomplished pianist and I love to play difficult pieces. During their most recent visit, while I was trying to play the Warsaw Concerto for my father, my family was talking over my grand piano, my niece was chasing my grand-niece through the living room and my sister-in-law was filming me, which was chaotic and terribly distracting. I think they were rude and disrespectful. How can I get them to stop this kind of behavior without sounding like a snotty jerk? -- SERIOUS MUSICIAN IN COLORADO.", "linesSec2": "DEAR MUSICIAN: When you wish to perform a concert for your father, entertain your parents apart from your sibling and the kids." } ] }
