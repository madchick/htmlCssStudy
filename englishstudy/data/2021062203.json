I'm a senior citizen with a do-not-resuscitate order. I am concerned that if something were to happen to me and I was taken to a nearby hospital, they wouldn't know I have one on file with my health care provider. Is there a way to let first responders know? Thank you for the continual service you provide. -- LAST REQUEST IN CALIFORNIA.", "linesSec2": "DEAR LAST REQUEST: Many individuals accomplish this by posting a notice near their bed, on the refrigerator or in their cellphone contact list designated as ICE (In Case of Emergency). There are also cards that can be carried in the wallet to alert the EMTs about the patient's wishes. Your health care provider can tell you how to get one." } ] }
