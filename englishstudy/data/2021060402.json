{ "title": "Neighborhood Group Celebrates Only Select Birthdays", "info":"Dear Abby | June 4th, 2021 | Letter 2 of 3", "image1":"./images/0401.jpg", "image2":"./images/0402.jpg", "lines":[ { "linesSec1": "DEAR ABBY: I live in an affluent neighborhood where a group of us get together for drinks, holidays, etc. But out of seven women in the group, only two or three are given birthday parties every year. The rest of us are never acknowledged -- not even with a card. I'm tired of going to celebrate someone else's birthday when mine is passed over with no mention. This may seem petty, but after years of this, it has gotten old. I've thought of saying something, but I'm not sure how to express it. Or should I just keep my mouth shut? -- OVERLOOKED IN SOUTH CAROLINA.", "linesSec2": "DEAR OVERLOOKED: Is everyone in that group aware of when all of the members' birthdays are? Because you haven't spoken up, they may not be. I don't think it would be poor form to pipe up at the next get-together that Jennifer, Angelina, Viola and you also have birthdays coming up and when they occur. If none of them are acknowledged after that, speak up as a group and say humorously that your feelings are hurt. However, if still no effort is made, the four or five of you should consider celebrating your birthdays separately." } ] }
