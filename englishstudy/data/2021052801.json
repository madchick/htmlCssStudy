I loved it and used it often. Two years ago, since we were moving out, I decided to let my sister take the rowing machine because my new apartment building had three and hers had no gym at all. It worked perfectly, and I thought I was doing her a favor because she couldn't afford a gym membership. My intention was to take back the rowing machine when I eventually had room to put it somewhere in a future home. Well, after recently moving into my new home and requesting she return it, she informed me that it was hers now. That was never my intention. She has gotten my other sister and our parents to side with her, and they're making me feel like a bad person for even asking for it. Now I'm left to shop for a new machine, while the original sits in her new large home gym along with her Peloton. She never offered to buy it, ever. She just insists it's hers now because I gave it to her. I still need a rowing machine, and I get upset every time I look at new ones online. It just feels wrong that I have to buy another one. What should I do? -- BUFF BRO IN ILLINOIS.", "linesSec2": "DEAR BRO: Buy another one. If it wasn't made absolutely clear to Sissy that you expected the rowing machine to be returned at a later date, she was within her rights to conclude that it was a gift. If you DID make that clear to her when you moved out, then shame on her. But either way, it's not worth a family feud." } ] }
