We love them both, and the divorce is amicable. They own a home, and my DIL is staying there. I worry about him sleeping in his truck every night, so I text him every night with a quick note. Am I being too much of a helicopter mom? I realize he has lived on his own since he was 19. (He is now 34.) -- LOVING PARENT IN UTAH My son is very easygoing and doesn't need the finer things in life. He has a truck. He built a small camper in the back, and there is a camper shell. We have asked him to move back in with us. He's going to school with about two years to go, and also works a full-time job. They had a fair amount of savings, but he doesn't want to buy a house right now. He thinks that since he is happy living in his truck, he should do that rather than waste money on an apartment. Rent is very high in our area so I understand, but we have a finished basement that he could live in..", "linesSec2": "DEAR PARENT: You have extended the offer. I assume that when the weather turns cold or he needs to take a shower or do a load of laundry, you have let him know that he is welcome to avail himself of your hospitality -- and have a nice dinner -- anytime he wishes. There are helicopter moms and hell-i-copter moms. You are neither. You are a loving, caring mom." } ] }
