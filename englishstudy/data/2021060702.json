However, it makes me sad and angry when I see flags that are torn and tattered. People, please. If your flag is in bad shape, take it down and dispose of it properly. Many organizations, police departments, fire departments, Girl and Boy Scouts, the VFW and American Legion collect worn and damaged flags and hold proper disposal ceremonies. Abby, please remind your readers who are proud of our country to be respectful of our flag. -- FLAG WAVER IN INDIANA.", "linesSec2": "DEAR FLAG WAVER: There are rules for appropriately displaying and disposing of our American flag, some of which proud Americans either choose to break or are ignorant about. (One that comes to mind addresses wearing clothing such as T-shirts, bathing suits -- and face masks -- bearing the likeness of the flag.) Many American Legion posts hold ceremonies once a year so people can dispose of flags that have seen better days. For those who are interested in learning more, and there is plenty more to learn, go online and type in a search for U.S. flag code." } ] }
