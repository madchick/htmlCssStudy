{ "title": "Man's Messiness Touches Nerve in Budding Romance", "info":"Dear Abby | June 25th, 2021 | Letter 1 of 2", "image1":"./images/0501.jpg", "image2":"./images/0502.jpg", "lines":[ { "linesSec1": "DEAR ABBY: I've become involved with a woman I've been friends with for some years. We became close over the course of 2020, and more recently have soft-launched dating (although she doesn't yet feel comfortable labeling it). Not long ago, she expressed great disappointment because of my messiness when I last visited her. I had left an empty coffee cup on her car floor, my shoes in the middle of her kitchen and knocked some pillows off of the couch, among other things. I know her criticisms are fair, but they were also over the top. I believe this is a trait I can fix, and I told her I would, but now she wants some space. She said she isn't sure she can become romantic with a messy person who doesn't respect her space. While I understand where she's coming from, I'm afraid I won't have a chance to prove myself. We spoke a little after the incident, but I have tried to honor her request. Do you have any advice about how to approach the situation? It would be sad if we parted ways after our first real challenge. I think it may be important to note that, in the past, she has dated men who weren't respectful to her at all. -- MR. MESSY IN PENNSYLVANIA.", "linesSec2": "DEAR MR. MESSY: A serious -- but nonconfrontational -- conversation with this woman is in order. Does she have a touch of OCD? Or could she be reluctant to become further involved for some other reason -- such as a fear of intimacy or her bad luck with prior men in her life? You need to ask what has caused your otherwise happy relationship to go so far off track, let her know you are willing to work on your messiness, and ask her to lay her cards on the table about what else may be bothering her." } ] }
