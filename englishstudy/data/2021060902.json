He has recently been hanging around a female friend who supposedly made a move on him while I was away, but he said he turned her down. He sends her private messages, looks her up on social media and likes every photo she puts up. Most of them are sexy. Now he wants to try new things in the bedroom. Should I be concerned? I have an uneasy feeling about this. When I told him I was going to confront her, he got upset with me. He has deleted messages because he said he didn't want me to get the wrong idea if I read them. I'm not sure how I should be feeling about this whole thing. -- SOMETHING'S UP IN NEW YORK.", "linesSec2": "DEAR SOMETHING'S UP: Right now you should be feeling your husband's relationship with this female friend is a threat. There's nothing innocent about deleting conversations that he knows would give you the wrong idea. His preoccupation with the sexy photos she is posting is hardly reassuring, and that he suddenly wants to try new things in the bedroom is a huge red flag in light of what else is going on. Quietly talk to a lawyer about what your options are as a wife of 14 years in New York, gather as much financial information as you can, and then raise holy heck with your husband. You have a right to be upset." } ] }
